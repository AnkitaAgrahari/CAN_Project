  ******************************************************************************

@par Example Description

How to set up a communication with the CAN in Normal mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 1 Mbit/s.

STM32 Disco boards LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED3 is Toggle when the reception is complete.
 


@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

Connectivity, CAN, Communication, Transmission, Reception,  

@par Directory contents 

  - CAN/CAN_Normal/Inc/stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h    HAL configuration file
  - CAN/CAN_Normal/Inc/main.h                  Header for main.c module  
  - CAN/CAN_Normal/Src/main.c                  Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F407xx/417xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F429I- Disco board , MCP255I1 CAN transciver , 120ohm resister and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
